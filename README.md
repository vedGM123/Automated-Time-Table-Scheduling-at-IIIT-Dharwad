# Automated Time-Table Scheduling at IIIT Dharwad

## 📌 Project Overview
This project automates the generation of class and examination timetables at IIIT Dharwad.  
It replaces the traditional manual scheduling process with an efficient, algorithm-driven system that considers constraints like faculty availability, classroom capacity, student enrollment, and course requirements.  

The goal is to generate **optimized, clash-free timetables** for lectures, labs, electives, and exams, saving time and minimizing errors.
